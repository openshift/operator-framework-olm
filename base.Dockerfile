# Install test dependencies
# TODO(tflannag): This is a quick fix to kubebuilder's quick start instructions
# that were failing e2e tests. We'll want to update our o/release ci-operator
# configuration to allow build_root changes to be reflected in a PR vs.
# instead of the CI pipeline always defaulting to building the HEAD version
# of the dockerfile:
# - https://docs.ci.openshift.org/docs/architecture/ci-operator/#build-root-image
# Note(tflannag): We ran into some issues curling from the https://go.kubebuilder.io/dl
# domain as the output file was HTLM-based, so curl from the github releases
# until this has been resolved.
